5. Commit changes

## Step 2: Create css/style.css
1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Type: `css/style.css` (this creates the css folder)
3. Copy the ENTIRE content from your current css/style.css file
4. Commit changes

4. Commit changes

## Step 4: Upload Profile Photo
1. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Create folder structure by uploading to: `assets/profile-photo.jpg`
3. Use any professional photo or the current placeholder will work

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
3. Save

Your portfolio will be live at: https://preranajangid.github.io/portfolio/

## Important Notes:
- Use your ACTUAL files, not the standalone version
- Keep the same folder structure: css/, js/, assets/
- The profile photo path in HTML should match: assets/profile-photo.jpg
- All external links (RangrezDecor, Looker Studio) will work exactly the same

This method preserves your exact styling, animations, and functionality.
